PACOS TRUST sees itself as on organisation that strives to empower indigenous communities through systematic building and strengthening of community organizations, which can act collectively on its own. PACOS TRUST also sees the need to support networking among organisations struggling to assert right over community resources and revitalizing indigenous systems. PACOS TRUST support community organisations in 14 districts (an increase of four from 2000/1) involving 23 geographical areas (including 7 new areas from last year), with each organization determining and implementing its own area plan and work programme. It has 60 personnel; almost all are working in their own community but also contributes to the organization by being part of different ad-hoc committees as resource persons depending on their skills and knowledge. PACOS TRUST hopes to have contacts in all 21 rural districts in Sabah with at least one community organization in each district. It also plans to boost its work on Land Rights by planning a 4-year land campaign, continue its effort to ensure active participants in regulating and protecting access to biological diversity and indigenous knowledge, participate and contribute actively in the Malaysia and Asia network, and provide input into development-related issues faced by indigenous communities. Much of the financial resources of PACOS TRUST are accrued from outside the country but it also raises funds through various activities (such as the research on forest-related knowledge with JOFCA-Japan, hosting international conferences) and contribution in kind by communities and its personnel. Among current major funding partners are the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (funding land/ resource management projects), DANCED (Pilot project on Wildlife Management in two areas, Community Research and Information), International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (Land Campaign), and Bernard Van Leer Foundation (Early Child Care and Development).

There is enough research to prove that urban farming is a great and simple solution all of us can embark on. The \u2018Pop\u2019 and team are committed to help turn every home into a food production machine as well. Through the use of appropriate technology and innovation, we can now build modular farm units that can suit different types of homes. Some of our designs are completely indoors.

We\u2019re here to make urban farming convenient, easy, and fun for everyone, one step at a time. We envision a world where people think of food in so much abundance, because every single person is producing food more then what they consume. Fresh, healthy and plenty! Let\u2019s put an end to our food problems, one house at a time. Fish feed plants, plants clean water for fish. Aquaponics is a more natural and efficient form of home farming. It\u2019s a symbiotic system of fish and plants, where through the simple act of feeding fish, you can quickly grow a variety of plants for cooking. The water in the system cycles around; plants love the nutrient rich fish water, and fish love the water being cleaned for them. This cycle is the age-old way nature has developed to sustain itself.

Our history The Selangor Family Aid Association is a voluntary multi racial welfare organisation. It was established on the 8th\u00a0of July 1988 by Mr Pusparajah Gunaratnam(G.P. Raj ), with the primary aim to help the needy such as the Old Folks, The Mentally Retarded , The Handicapped, The Down Syndrome and The Orphanage children etc. .In the past, the Association has also helped with provisions for the Poor and The Orang Asli (natives), and provided school meals for less privileged children. Due to the growing demands with the in house residents and lack of funding it has become necessary to just focus on the residents at hand. Originally, the residents were accommodated in\u00a0rented houses comprising a total of 12 residents. As the numbers grew, it was getting increasingly difficult to meet the needs of the residents. Hence, our founder member Mr G. P. Raj decided to build a better and a more permanent home for this unfortunate and under privileged society. Currently, The Association has 87 residents and are able to accommodate up to 150. We also have about 15 members of staff, providing the necessary help and medical attention in the management of the home. To maintain the home successfully, the Association is in constant need of funds, approximately Rm47,000 per month. At this level of funding, it is often a huge challenge. However, the management is always looking forward for ways in pushing the boundaries further in its struggle to have a smooth operation of the home. Our objectives Our activities The residents are always encouraged to participate in recommended daily\u00a0 activities in order to keep their minds and bodies in healthy condition. These are considered to be therapeutic and a good pastime. Although most of the residents are not capable to carry out any responsible activities of their own, the staff do however conduct special occupational therapy programmes such as handy crafts and painting. At times, the residents are given outing entertainments usually by voluntary groups. These may include dinners, social functions and other sight seeing activities. Our needs Monthly expenses: RM47,000 We therefore appeal to your sympathetic and humanitarian sentiments in helping us to provide the basic amenities of life to these underprivileged human beings who are in want of attention and proper care.

Sometime in the late 1970s, a group of young Christians were inspired to put their faith into action.\u00a0 A Board was soon elected in 1978, comprising 11 visionaries like Wong Kim Kong, Lim Heng Seng, Lim Wei Meng, Shirley Lee, Jack Cheah, Liew Chee Kien, Steven Chong and Doreen Chan, with David Boler, Rev. Douglas Anderson and Timothy Phua as advisors. Malaysian Care became official in 1979 as a registered establishment and started its first home \u201cRumah Care\u201d which provided shelter for children whose parents were patients at Sungai Buloh Leprosarium. On 1st January 1980, Rev Peter Young was appointed the first Executive Director of Malaysian Care. From then till now, our purpose remains to encourage active social work amongst the churches in Malaysia, being the visible expression of the wholistic mission of Christ although the expressions of our actions may be have taken different directions according to the needs of the current time. Where we are today Malaysian Care today is an organisation offering diversified services such as residential care and community services and is strongly committed to community development. Beginning with just a staff team of five, today we have over 60 staff. Apart from direct services by staff and partners, we seek to inform, educate and encourage Christians to be involved with the poor and deprived. Malaysian Care also offers consultancy, partnerships and networking with Churches and groups to set up social caring ministries across Malaysia.

We gather in solidarity and goodwill, with the common aim of making the world a better place. We aim to streamline the environmental movement in Malaysia, through these interconnected functions: What do we mean by connecting the green dots? What, or who, are the green dots? There are a few ways of looking at this. There are many environmentalists or environmentally conscious people trying to do the right thing, and to champion the right causes. However, many of these efforts are scattered and do not get the visibility that they deserve. By connecting them together, we actually see the collective effort, whether for purposes of networking, sharing resources, or just for solidarity. Also, on one hand, organizations working on environmental issues complain of being understaffed and overworked; and on the other hand, people who want to help do not know how to start. We aim to bridge the gap and rectify this problem. The environmental scene is composed of different sectors of stakeholders. Government departments and policymakers, NGOs and social enterprises, the private sector with their green technology\u2026 they need to talk to each other, and work together. This is a platform that cuts across different sectors and shows what everyone is doing. Within the environmental community, we have different interest groups \u2013 the organic movement, the activists on specific crises, the conservationists, to name a few. There is significant overlap in their goals, and potential collaborations can happen. And then there are different communities in different localities \u2013 the urban, the rural; the local, the regional, and the international. As environmental crises become more and more frequent and widespread, it is increasingly apparent that all of us are susceptible to issues like climate change, mass extinction of animal species, industrial pollution, and so on. Beyond the environmental community, we try to reach out to other communities such as the arts, the civil rights groups, students\u2026 to alert and engage a larger segment of the population. Issues of environmentalism and sustainability cut across multiple disciplines, and the problems are often bigger than what we can understand. This is why we invite thinkers, academics, journalists, scientists, activists\u2026 people who are on the ground, to write for us, and to link these ideas together for us to see a clearer, bigger picture. So, how do we connect the dots? For the time being, we have two projects: We provide a central space for people to publish their profiles, events, actions, articles and announcements. Anyone can sign up and use the system to publicize their good actions, or ideas. The platform is free to use, and we market it to three populations: the people who are out there doing good actions, the people who want to start something, and those who are potentially interested to join in. We organize a monthly get-together where like-minded people can come hang out and get to know each other, over a thought-provoking movie. The event is free to attend. We want to get people to network face-to-face, and generate conversations from the featured documentaries. During the Documentary Night, we also have a 15-minute slot for whoever who wants to talk about their organization, event or action. Similar to our Monthly Documentary Night, but we screen films featuring \u201cCrossover\u201d topics: Economics, politics, capitalism, democracy, mass media, etc\u2026 all these topics (and many more) are directly or indirectly linked with the natural world that we live in.

They were desirous of\u00a0setting up a foundation to carry out activities to complement\u00a0the efforts of the government of Malaysia to further lift the standard of education in Malaysia as\u00a0outlined in the Plan Pembangunan Pendidikan Malaysia 2013-2025 (PPPM 2013-2025). In particular, while the PPPM 2013-25 is very comprehensive,\u00a0there are always areas where non-governmental organisations can play meaningful synergistic\u00a0roles. One of these areas lies in the contributions of\u00a0PTAs of schools. PTAs that are active can offer good support to schools, enabling the school\u2019s management to\u00a0conduct various initiatives over and above what the government can provide. These initiatives\u00a0will obviously benefit the students, giving them a better\u00a0chance at academics, as well as, all-rounded excellence. However, the abilities of PTAs to offer the much needed support to the schools differ widely due\u00a0to a multitude of reasons. Schools in the rural areas,\u00a0in the interior, as well as urban poor\u00a0schools face greater challenges compared to urban schools. These challenges include poor\u00a0leadership, lack of support from parents of students, low financial resources and poor basic\u00a0infrastructure. It is therefore not surprising that in terms of performance, annual statistics\u00a0continue to show urban students performed better compared to those in the rural areas, in the\u00a0interiors and in urban poor schools. The government of Malaysia is aware of this gap in performance. In fact, this gap is listed as a\u00a0priority item in the (PPPM 2013-2025) and many initiatives\u00a0and action plans in this document are\u00a0aimed at bridging this gap.YSPM wishes to complement\u00a0the efforts of the government to bridge\u00a0this gap in overall performance between urban students and students in the rural areas, in the\u00a0interiors and in urban poor schools. \u00a0YSPM intends to do this by\u00a0offering support and assistance to PTAs of schools, especially\u00a0schools in the rural areas, in the interiors and urban poor schools. This, in essence, is\u00a0what YSPM is all about. \u00a0In order to accomplish this, funds are needed. YSPM is grateful to the government of Malaysia\u00a0for providing the initial grant to set up this foundation but its continuous existence will require\u00a0funding assistance from corporations or individuals. In this respect, YSPM is unique as it is\u00a0an officially recognised platform through which contributions can be made to benefit PTAs of\u00a0schools in Malaysia. \u00a0YSPM was officially incorporated on 03 November 2014 as\u00a0a company limited by guarantee and\u00a0not having a share capital. Its patron is the Minister of Education of Malaysia. \u00a0We hope you share our vision and we invite you to be part of this noble effort to nurture and\u00a0develop our young.

The Heart Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the control of heart and blood vessel disease. In the 1960\u2019s, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet the needs and demands of the population. With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now, there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later, heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and blood vessel diseases. We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In 1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards, this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia. The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation\u2019s heart-health message is direct and effective \u2013 enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly.\nEstimated Monthly Expenditure: Please contact YJM directly Our needs\n Volunteers are welcome to participate in various activities.

We aim to reduce their stress and suffering whilst creating a positive and stimulating environment during their last days together. Our vision is that we become the leading non-governmental organisation providing complementary palliative care services to underprivileged children and their families in Malaysia. ANGSANAcare is a fully registered not-for-profit Malaysian Society created as a support service to palliative care for underprivileged paediatric patients and their families in Government hospitals in Malaysia. Our services are free of charge. We depend completely on public and corporate funding and are not affiliated to any political or religious groups. In 2011, Dr Loh Ee Chin of UMMC identified a need for a type of special care for her palliative care patients who were suffering enormous pain and extreme stress. In Singapore and in most Western countries, doctors were tapping into the expertise of art, play and music therapies that were not often used in Malaysia. Dr. Loh was determined to introduce such complementary support for the children in her care. She approached a music therapist in Kuala Lumpur who was eager to volunteer her services. The benefits of this type of therapy were immediately evident. She discovered that the children were becoming less fearful and, in turn, experiencing less pain. A sense of calm and internal well-being was restored to them. Singing or playing with musical instruments with the therapist allowed children to experience joy; songs and poetry helped them to express their innermost fears for the future. The next step was to secure funding for this pilot programme. Ms. Chung, herself a cancer survivor, generously offered her financial support; for three years she paid for a music therapist at University Malaya medical Centre. In 2014, Dr. Loh trained a younger paediatrician, Dr. Lee Chee Chan, in Palliative Care. He too was drawn to music therapy, recognising its benefits as a complementary component to his medical care. The doctors together decided to expand these services to more families. This would now be beyond the capacity of a few individuals so Ms Chung approached Datin Catherine Lai who already ran another charity and had her hands full.\u00a0 Catherine, having mulled over the idea for a couple of months, invited her friend, Ria Thomas; someone she knew would make a serious commitment to the initiative, to the next meeting with the doctors. To her complete surprise, Ria, who thought she was just attending a meeting, was asked to become the Chairperson of this new and yet unnamed entity. Ria Thomas founded the new Society, ANGSANAcare.\u00a0 She picked a committee of dedicated members whose comprehensive vision was to offer much more than expressive arts therapy alone. The \u2018A Little Wish\u2019 programme was introduced and the support network was expanded to include group sessions for children in art and music. The enthusiasm and hard work of this team, led to the inauguration and registration of ANGSANAcare, a new Malaysian Society, on the 3rd March 2015.", "Email address": "info@angsanacare.org", "Website": "http://www.angsanacare.org/", "Year of establishment": "2015", "Address": "PO Box 507, F139 BSC, 285 Jalan Maarof, 59000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Registration number": "PPM-026-14-03032015"}, {"Source": "http://www.hati.my/children/persatuan-kebajikan-rumah-perlindungan-teratak-nur-insan-kuala-lumpur-dan-selangor-nuri/", "Name": "Persatuan Kebajikan Rumah  Perlindungan Teratak Nur Insan  Kuala Lumpur Dan Selangor (NURI)", "Description": "Who are we NURI has been registered with ROS and approved on 8 September 2007 ( WKL 1746-07 ).

As a progressive, democratic and concerned youth and students group, we are very much involved in providing our energy, creativity, ideas and ideals in community based activities and programmes with underprivileged and marginalised communities. We feel that a bridge between student sector and other oppressed sectors from society should be built to link and strengthen the various pro-democracy forces in our country. For a long time a vacuum has existed between the student sector and other sectors in society. At this point in time, there are not many programmes and activities being implemented to bridge and link students other sectors in society. As such, it seems that student groups in our country are isolated from the rest of society. Our programmes We feel that this situation should be addressed through committed initiative to fill in the social vacuum with various community-based programmes and activities, which are dynamic and progressive. This vacuum needs to be filled before the gap between students and other sectors in society becomes bigger and bigger. The involvement of students in community based programmes and other activities that are pro-people need to be implemented without any delay. Hence, initiatives and continuous commitment from the students must be implemented from now on through progressive educational programmes and activities. We feel these programmes and activities should be handled and organised by the students themselves as a means for them to be independent, critical and creative in organising themselves as well as in organising the people they work with. Our challenges\n However, the bureaucratic structure in all universities in Malaysia today has stifled the growth of students to be independent minded, creative, progressive and critical in looking at and being involved in issues that affect society. Student Affairs Division \u2013 Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar (HEP) was formed to control and monitor student programmes and activities. This means that programmes and activities organised by students must get permission and approval from HEP before they can be implemented. All activities that are seen as undesirable in the eyes of HEP such as students putting up a firm stand on human rights violation in Malaysia or student involvement with democratic reform in Malaysia, are dealt with in a very undemocratic and severe manner. Either students involved are reprimanded, suspended or expelled; or their proposed programmes and activities are rejected. The campuses climate and environment that are not conducive; the democratic space and opportunities for the student to be intellectually developed and expanded being stifled; and the enforcement of repressive laws of Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) preventing students from involving in pro-democracy activism; is definitely not a suitable element in order to produce students and youths that are committed, courageous, creative, critical and full of idealism. Why University of Bangsar Utama ? Since 1998, an area in Bangsar Utama has become a place for student activists from various campuses in Kuala Lumpur to hang out and discuss progressive theories, current affairs and issues as well as looking at how we can contribute and participate actively in democratic reform in our country. From a mere discussion, it evolved into the implementation of our ideas and ideals when we finally decided to rent a space in Bangsar Utama on April 2000 as our base and operational center to plan and implement all our community based programs and activities. Choosing the name for our own little democratic place as University of Bangsar Utama is for re-socialising and re-educating ourselves as responsible students and youths for the benefit of society. Programs and Activities Our programs and activities are based on cultivating, nurturing and building the personality of students and youths to be confident and conscious, progressive and democratic, creative and courageous, critical and responsible. We feel that the best methodology to install such positive virtues is through education and training programs. Therefore, our programs and activities offered to the communities, youth and students are based on Education Programs. Our education programs are divided into 3 categories. First, education programs for the community in Bangsar Utama. Second, for the students in various university campuses in Kuala Lumpur and third for the public. Community of Bangsar Utama Our programmes are: All the programmes and activities offered are free of charge. Our programmes for University Students and Youth include: Our programmes for the general public include: Educational Street Theatre and Agit-prop performance for the public\nMusical performances with progressive songs for the public Our street theatre, agit-prop, music and songs include progressive element on human rights, democracy and social justice. Democratic Reform and Civil and Political Rights Movement UBU student activists are also involved in the struggle for democratic reform and civil and political right movement by participating in civil disobedience. SUARAM is one of the NGOs that UBU student activists have a working relationship with. Our student activists have been selected by SUARAM to join a Fact Finding Mission for Achenes Refugees in 1999 and as Observers in the Indonesian 1999 General Election organised by Asian Network For Free and Fair Elections (ANFREL). Last year, we also collaborated with SUARAM as a joint organiser for protest against Internal Security Act (ISA) in front of ISA Detention Centre in Kamunting. In November 1999, with assistance from ERA (Education Research Association) we had organised a Human Rights Training Camp for five days in Port Dickson with more than 60 students from various campuses in Malaysia join the programmes. And in March 2001 together with SUARAM we organised a two day Human Rights Workshop on Police Power and Citizen Rights for university students and youths. Our aspirations\n With this brief introduction of us as the University of Bangsar Utama Student Group, our programmes and activities as well as what we stand for, our ideas and ideals of contributing actively for the advancement of democratic reform and the building of a just society in our country; we hope that a further commitment and relationship can be explored, advanced and achieved between us.", "Email address": "universiti_bangsar@yahoo.com", "Phone number": "+6 012 252 1711 (Black)", "Year of establishment": "2000", "Address": "52 C, Jalan Kemuja, Bangsar Utama, 59000, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA  "}, {"Source": "http://www.hati.my/support-groups/than-hsiang-mitra-welfare-associaiton-penang/", "Name": "Than Hsiang Mitra Welfare Associaiton Penang", "Description": "Than Hsiang Welfare Mitra Center is a Welfare Association that provide counseling service, welfare support and public awareness through Seminar and talk.", "Email address": "mitrapenang@gmail.com", "Website": "http://www.facebook.com/ThanHsiangMitraWelfareAssociationPenang", "Phone number": "+604-645 1141", "Address": "132, Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah, 11900 Bayan Lepas, Pulau Pinang"}, {"Source": "http://www.hati.my/disabled/ideas-autism-centre/", "Name": "IDEAS Autism Centre", "Description": "In October 2012, the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) took the initiative to set up the IDEAS Autism Centre (IAC) in Rawang, Selangor, as part of our effort to provide care for those in need, and at the same time to research and develop a sustainable social enterprise model that can be replicated to help underprivileged children. The IAC is registered with the Department for Social Welfare (reg no: B/TI 151/2012) Good quality care should be accessible for everyone.

The centre operates from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm. During this time, children attending the IAC receive daily care services, speech therapy, occupational therapy, as well as educational support to prepare them for mainstream school.

History The \u201cAggiornamento-Renewal\u201d of 1976 brought into focus the need for the Church in Malaysia to begin its process of renewal by identifying Integral Human Development (IHD) as one of her core needs. Thus, began the journey of the Church in Malaysia to express her \u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d, through Charity, Integral Human Development, Justice and Peace. This saw the gradual establishment of Offices for Human Development in each of the Arch/Dioceses. The thrust initiated by the Catholic Welfare Services (CWS) / National Office for Human Development (NOHD), as a result of the decision of the Peninsular Malaysia Catholic Bishops, was to set up the Peninsular Malaysia Lenten Campaign Committee. The resultant awareness and education was the vehicle to deepen our understanding of the meaning of our Christian commitment to living the gospels today. Structures for formation, direct services to the needy and administration, including the responsibility to make available financial resources were set up. By the year 1995, the Arch/Dioceses in Peninsular Malaysia adopted Program the Programme Approach as a response to Vision 2020. We identified our priority areas as follows: With the growing demands of the various ministries especially in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it was deemed necessary to set up the Archdiocesan Office for Human Development (AOHD) in separate premises from the NOHD, where it had originally been located since its establishment in the 1990s. This \u201cseparation\u201d was the result of the increasing programs, activities and services at the level of the Archdiocese, as well as our growing conviction for the need to link our Parish Integral Human Development Ministries (PIHDMs) with our Basic Ecclesial Communities (BECs). Thus, one of the priority area of focus of the AOHD is to set up PIHDMs in every parish, so that more effective pastoral care can be given to people who are suffering and in pain in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our vision  To be one with God, in solidarity with the whole human family and creation. Our mission To witness to Christ through service, integral human development, justice and peace. Our objectives To create mission awareness and outreach among the Catholic faithful in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur. To network with governmental bodies, civil society organizations and believers of other faiths towards the creation of a more humane society. To work closely with Parish Integral Human Development Ministries (PIHDM) and Basic Ecclesial Communities (BECs) in all parishes in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur so that more effective pastoral care can be provided to the poor and marginalized in their respective communities. To provide direct services to the five priority groups: To organise on-going formation programs, in particular, on Catholic social teachings, and spiritual and practical skills for PIHD ministry work. To manage the Archdiocesan Lenten Campaign funds for the undertaking of humanitarian projects. To serve as a resource and information centre on matters pertaining to charity, integral human development, justice and peace.", "Contact person": "Mr. Tony Wee", "Email address": "enquiry@aohd.org", "Website": "http://www.aohd.org", "Phone number": "+603 2078 1570", "Fax number": "+603 2078 1560", "Year of establishment": "1990", "Address": "5 Jalan Bukit Nanas 50250 Kuala Lumpur Malaysia"}, {"Source": "http://www.hati.my/children/shepherds-centre-foundation/", "Name": "Shepherd\u2019s Centre Foundation", "Description": "Who are we\n Registration Number: 496903P\nBy Whom: Pastor Jacop and Bridget David It was officially launched in 1994 as a foster home for orphans, abandoned, abused and neglected children from broken families.

When the church decided to close down the centre in 2006, the children were literally left in the lurch. The staff too had no other place to go. The parents, despite having helped to raise funds had no recourse as the centre belonged to the church which had the legal right to close it down. Out of desperation, in the same year, parents and well-wishers came together and registered Persatuan Orang Kurang Upaya Bangsa Ria KL & Selangor (Bangsa Ria Association for the Disabled KL & Selangor) as a legal, registered society under the Registrar of Societies (registration no. 0873-06-SEL). Our children Each child is different: some are autistic or display autistic behaviour. Others severely mentally challenged with various disabilities. One has Down\u2019s. Each has their own timetable of training activities to best develop their skills. The less mentally disabled have activities ranging from picture puzzles, colouring to simple writing, maths, beading and fixing blocks (hand-eye coordination). For others, even scooping food on a spoon and placing the spoon into the mouth is a fantastic skill, as is indicating that they need to use the toilet. Each child has a time period in the Snoezelen Room which is a safe, fun, cool sensory stimulation area which even normal kids (and adults) love! We celebrate all the children\u2019s birthdays and festivals. Many of our children may not be able to speak but they know, understand and respond to love, kindness, joy and genuine sincerity. Our mission Bangsa Ria offers a sanctuary for the disabled, providing individualised training to push each child to the best of their abilities. Training, mental and sensory stimulation, meals, snacks, friendship and above all, loving caring is at the core of Bangsa Ria.\u00a0 Our centre opens from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Mondays to Fridays. Each child has a separate training programme based on individual assessment. The skills and therapeutic training activities include: Our fund-raising activities Almost every year, we organise a jumble sale at our premises. This sale has a 3-fold function. One, we raise funds. Two, we raise public awareness of our centre in the media. Three, we price most items at very low figures and sometimes give them away. As many customers come from the lower income bracket and some are foreign workers, this is our contribution to society in thanks for the many kindnesses shown to us. We also take part in the annual Austrian-German-Swiss (AGS) Christmas Bazaar selling items made by generous contributors. AGS too has become a very kind contributor to our centre. Apart from selling items made by others, we cannot do much as our children are too severely mentally disabled to make things on their own. Our needs Bangsa Ria collects a monthly contribution of RM400/- per child, who are provided with breakfast, lunch and tea. Our monthly outgoings total near to RM10,000/-. We need to emphasise here that only the staff are paid. The committee members receive no allowance whatsoever for their work whether administrative, travelling or any other expenses incurred. In fact, we often pay out of our own pockets even for treats for the children, stationery or postage. At Bangsa Ria, age is not a factor, nor religion, nor race. Our doors are open to all and we are strictly secular. We accept every disabled person who wants our help and we welcome every kind of help, in cash, kind and time. Please make all cheques payable to: Persatuan Orang Kurang Upaya Bangsa Ria KL Dan Selangor. Our Bangsa Ria children (they are all children in mind, though the oldest is 39) may not always be able to show their appreciation of your contributions. Rest assured, we, the staff and parents, will. Thank you for reaching out to our children. Thank you on behalf of Bangsa Ria. Our Dream 1. To have a permanent place of our own. 2. A benefactor to cover our monthly excess expenditure. 3. A caring corporate foundation to take over the Centre, as eventually, parents would not be around to see to our children\u2019s welfare. Our current situation Bangsa Ria faces the problem of having to find a new premise in the near future as the owner of the present premise is asking for the property back. The Centre also have problems trying to get its Snoozelen Room equipment repaired. The room is a place of dazzling colors, sounds and images, built to stimulate the minds of the children, and to promote their sensory skills of touch, sight and sound. \u00a0", "Email address": "bangsaria@gmail.com/bangsariacentre@gmail.com", "Website": "http://profmediaworkshop.wixsite.com/bangsariacentre", "Phone number": "03-7960 0560", "Address": "No. 584, Jalan 17/17, 46400 Petaling Jaya", "Registration number": "0873-06-SEL"}, {"Source": "http://www.hati.my/other-communities/dapur-jalanan-kuala-lumpur/", "Name": "Dapur Jalanan Kuala Lumpur", "Description": "\u2014- Dapur Jalanan, a volunteer-based soup kitchen service operates every Sunday at Jalan Panggong, in Kuala Lumpur.

The man behind the establishment of Sabah Foundation was the Father of Independence of Sabah, the late Tun Datu Haji Mustapha bin Datu Harun, whose vision was to promote a Malaysian consciousness among the people of Sabah. The objectives of the foundation are providing education and educational facilities for all Malaysians in Sabah; creating opportunities for a more equitable distribution of economic wealth among the people in Sabah; and providing aids to charitable institutions and victims of natural disasters. Over the years, the Group has diversified its activities to meet the needs of the day and to keep the forest under its custody in perpetuity. From simply harvesting to downstream processing of timber, the Group ventured into new areas such as agro-plantation, hospitality and tourism, shipping and real estate development in the mid eighties.\u00a0In the last decade, the Group ventured further away from mainstream forestry into biotechnology and horticulture besides fisheries and food industries. In the last five years, to meet global demand and an ever challenging business world, the Group has ventured into the oil and gas industry, MICE and information technology. After more than 48 years in existence, the Group has flourished, achieving its objectives of providing scholarships and loans to needy students as well as students who excelled academically to further their studies locally and abroad. The Group provided launching grant for the initial MARA Institute of Technology in Sabah at Sembulan, Kota Kinabalu, which now houses its very own Kolej Yayasan Sabah. The Group is also proud to have given a launching grant for Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Sabah Branch at Limauan, Kinarut. In 1995, the Group built a \u2018fast track\u2019 college campus for the temporary use of Universiti Malaysia Sabah at Likas, adjacent to the Menara Tun Mustapha. With the success in providing education to many graduates, the standard of living of the people improved tremendously. Equal opportunities were created for the people to make a successful living, especially those living in the rural areas of Sabah. Apart from providing education opportunities and educational facilities, the Group carries out Social People Development programmes throughout Sabah through its office in six zones. Through these programmes, in-situ local folks especially housewives, retirees, unemployed youths and single parents are exposed to new methods, through workshops and seminars on how to start small businesses. Being an advocator of conservation, the Group has set aside four conservation areas namely the Danum Valley (43,800 hectares), Maliau Basin (58,840 hectares), Imbak Canyon (30,000 hectares) and Tumunong Hallu (171 hectares). In the Southeast Asian region, the Group has established itself as a pioneer in good forest management, leader in conservation efforts, and rehabilitation of logged-over-forest. It is also successful in agro-plantation, especially oil palm, and known worldwide for its biotechnology exports of tissue culture of superior quality teak. From a humble beginning in forestry, the Group has jumped by leaps and bounds into the global business arena and continues to compete with the best. Vision To be a dynamic, people oriented, caring and committed organisation Mission To Enhance the quality of life of Malaysians in Sabah Core Values Honest, Committed, Caring, Dynamic, Firm, Resilient, and Result-Oriented. Objectives 1. Uplifting the quality of education and educational facilities as well as providing educational opportunities for the people of Sabah. 2. Relieving of poverty; and 3.

Sejarah bermula apabila seorang bapa telah meninggal dunia dengan meninggalkan 9 orang anak kecil dalam tanggungannya. Susulan daripada kejadian itu, anak-anak yatim tersebut telah dijadikan keluarga angkat oleh Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli selama lebih kurang sebelas bulan. Kebetulan pula pada masa itu, Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli adalah Imam masjid Al-Islahiyah batu 17 \u00be Kuang. Hal ini pula diketahui oleh ahli jawatan kuasa Masjid Al-Islahiyah dan masing-masing merasakan bahawa suatu usaha yang lebih baik harus dilakukan demi kebajikan anak-anak tersebut di masa akan datang. Maka lahirlah satu kata sepakat untuk menubuhkan sebuah asrama anak-anak yatim di Kuang. Alhamdulillah, hasrat ini terus menjadi kenyataan apabila seorang hamba Allah telah mewakafkan sebidang tanah seluas 0.5 ekar di Lorong teratai, Kuang bagi tujuan pembinaan asrama tersebut dan pemegang hak milik tanah tersebut telah diserahkan kepada Bahagian Wakaf, Majlis Agama Islam Selangor (MAIS) dan Masjid Al-Islahiah Kuang telah menubuhkan Jawatankuasa sementara bagi menguruskan asrama anak yatim di tanah tersebut. Jawatankuasa yang dipengerusikan oleh Tuan Haji Suhaimi telah memulakan kerja-kerja bagi mendapatkan pembiayaan untuk membina bangunan asas bagi menempatkan anak-anak yatim tersebut. Pembiayaan daripada orang persendirian dan syarikat korporat telah membantu Jawatankuasa tersebut bagi membina satu blok penempatan bagi keluarga malang tersebut. Perkembangan pusat ini telah menarik perhatian ramai dimana pada tahun 1991 seramai 74 orang anak-anak yatim telah di tempatkan di pusat ini. Kebanyakan mereka adalah penduduk yang berada di sekitar dan Negeri Selangor. Perletakan batu asas Asrama Damai ini pula telah dilakukan pada hari Ahad, 18 Oktober 1992 bersamaan 22 Rabiulakhir 1413 Hijrah oleh Y.B Dato\u2019 Abu Bakar bin Abdul Hamid, DSSA, SMS, PPK, PJK. Beliau ketika itu merupakan ahli majlis mesyuarat kerajaan negeri Selangor Darul Ehsan. Dari masa ke semasa penghuni asrama ini semakin bertambah dan pertambahan juga pada keluasan asrama tanah wakaf asrama kepada enpat ekar di atas nama waqaf untuk Asrama Damai, Kuang. Asrama ini pernah dikunjungi oleh Al-Marhum Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, bersama bersama Tuanku Permaisuri untuk mencemar duli bagi melawat seluruh kawasan asrama ini. Keperluan kami Pada masa ini asrama menempatkan seramai 116 orang anak-anak yatim serta 11 orang ibu-ibu tunggal yang menghuni asrama ini. Manakala bagi tenaga pengurusan asrama ini melibatkan 15 orang dan dibantu oleh ibu-ibu tunggal tersebut. Perbelanjaan bagi menguruskan asrama melibatkan kos yang tinggi dan semakin meningkat dimana dianggarkan sebanyak RM 30 \u2013 40 ribu sebulan diperlukan bagi membiayai perbelanjaan bulanan asrama.

They are one of the last few nomads remaining in the world. The Penan are noted for their practice of \u2018Molong\u2019 which means never taking more than necessary. Most Penan were nomadic hunter-gatherers until the post-World War II missionaries settled many of the Penan, mainly in the Ulu-Baram and Ulu Limbang district. They hunt for animals which they eat and use the hides, skin, fur, and other parts for clothing and shelter. They gather fruits and plants which are also used as medicines. Penan communities were predominantly nomadic up until the 1950s. The period from 1950 till present has seen consistent programmes by the state government and foreign Christian missionaries to settle Penan into longhouse-based villages similar to those of Sarawak\u2019s other indigenous groups. The Penan in Borneo are mainly Semi-nomadic and their way of life is changing due to pressures that encourage them to live in permanent settlements and adopt year-around farming. They are subsistence farmer, growing dry padi, tapioca and corn for consumption. Very often they still return to the forest to hunt and to the river to fish. Today , the Penan are scattered in many Penan settlements in the forested part of Sarawak. They face challenges of dwindling supply of resources and food.

Conceptualized and organized by not-for-profit environmental organization, EcoKnights, the Festival is a platform to facilitate building a nation of ecologically conscious businesses, individuals, and communities through on-ground activities and film screenings focused on critical environmental issues and stories such as pollution, trans-boundary haze, indigenous people\u2019s rights, wildlife protection, nuclear energy, climate change, sustainable food production, waste management, local environmental heroes and more. We hope that the audiences will leave feeling that they can be a part of the solution to environmental problems. With a growing public awareness for the environment, the Festival aims to increase this groundswell through inspiring and educational films which hopefully will motivate people to go out and make a difference in their community and around the world. We involve environmental organizations and green businesses through the Green Market, where groups can share opportunities to get involved and promote sustainable consumption and productions.While we will feature national and international films, we also hope to highlight the works of local filmmakers and foster an interest in environmental film making through mentoring and a filmmaking forum. An important component is the opportunity for open discussion related to the films, either with filmmakers or with experts on the film\u2019s topic.

Some 57% of refugees and asylum-seekers are men, while 43% are women. Also, there are 33,740 children below the age of 18. Secondly, the population of Malaysia in the year of 2013 equalled to 29.72 million, while the population of Kuala Lumpur equals to 1.589 million. Unfortunately, there are no proven statistics regarding the number of undocumented foreigners in the country. Adding to that, there are no refugee camps in Malaysia and refugees live in small low cost over crowded flats in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor areas. And there are no legal or administrative frameworks in place in country in order to address the refugee situation. Also, there is no difference between refugees and undocumented migrants in Malaysian law, therefore the possibility of them getting arrested is quite high and they have no access to formal employment. Nevertheless, their children don\u2019t have access to formal education. Even though they have access to health care but the costs are usually unaffordable for them.

He was beaten up and was in a very bad condition. He was neglected by a neighbour. One day he wandered away and luckily showed up at our gate. We stood up against the neighbour, kept him & nursed him to health. Today Ruff is a healthy boy and his loyalty & dedication to us is beyond words. Ruff\u2019s past suffering made us want to reach out to other animals that are ill-treated and are in danger. So, we started rescuing animals. In the span of two years, to date, we\u2019ve rescued about\u00a0200 animals\u00a0that have been abused or injured. FKF has chosen to focus specifically in rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of abused or injured animals as we feel personally called upon to stop cruelty towards animals. The past two years, we\u2019ve been a self-funded movement. We converted our home into a sanctuary and shared it with the animals we saved. We have a team that gave up their respective careers to dedicate themselves to this cause.At the end of 2014, we chose to go public regarding our work and also register as a non-profit charity in order to allow us to reach more animal in need as well as to spread word on the fight against cruelty towards animals. Our facilities FKF is currently located at our own home. As such our presence is not accepted by all our neighbours and we\u2019ve had incidents of neighbours beating, trying to poison and other abusive actions such as dousing our animals with hot water. Our location also does not meet local city council regulations. For all these reason it is critical that FKF move to a location that is safer for our animals. Our center is not equipped with any facilities. We build temporary cages as we need them to house the animals. The reason for this is space constraints as well as financial strain. We are in talks with UPM Vet to obtain discounts for treatments. However we still need sponsors for pet food. Our major financial strain is the medical cost of our animals as well as providing them food. We are also looking to move to a new location in Kuala Kubu Bharu to a land donated to us for shelter use. However, the land is in a valley which requires land clearing and building of a shelter, both of which we need sponsor for. We are also in talks with the Selangor State Government to try obtain a flat piece of land in a more accessible location. This will reduce our land clearing cost as well as make the centre available to local communities. We are also trying to allow the centre to generate income to fund itself. The plan is to set up an online shop selling pet food and other related items. Towards this end, we are still looking for suppliers and delivery companies who can partner with us.

APE Malaysia participates in on-going conservation projects with willing partners who share the same ethos and who are working towards common conservation outcomes. People and organisations can become involved in these projects either through APE\u2019s volunteering program, education program or set up Corporate Responsibility projects. Whether used singly or combined, these methods are used in creative and unique ways to create distinct and dynamic programmes that highlight APE\u2019s model of addressing environment + economics + people in everything it does. There are 2 project sites at which APE currently delivers this approach. Each site has existing conservation or animal welfare programmes that are run by trustworthy partners, Government departments and/or NGOs. APE\u2019s participation and support are driven by the needs of the individual site and designed to be sustainable.

Social values like growing a strong foundation, being a force for good, collaboration while maintaining individuality, life-giving leadership, and so on. We find that these values are shared by both man (social) and nature (ecological). For example, \u2018fruitfulness\u2019 is a common value and purpose in both nature and humans. And just as \u2018diversity\u2019 makes a natural ecosystem resilient, so does it foster better human societies. In building that understanding, we hope that people may be inspired by the goodness of nature to bring about the goodness of humanity. Good Stewards is the first to conduct a programme like this. To be what we advocate \u2013 transforming society for good \u2013 we run it as a social enterprise. That means while we\u2019re doing what we love, we include underprivileged brothers and sisters in the program. Also, any profits go to them after paying ourselves a modest salary. Why are we doing this We think it\u2019s fabulous to be reflecting on good ol\u2019 virtues and values in the good ol\u2019 woods. But after getting cold feet about actually doing it for good people, we\u2019re glad that there\u2019s much more that motivate us besides a fabulous idea.\u00a0 We believe our society can become better in many ways \u2013 daily compassion, more creativity in life ambitions, care for the needy. And it starts with the individual. Because when we choose to make a better society, we choose to first make a difference in ourselves. And so it is our deed as Good Stewards. We hope to inspire and encourage a few to embrace a higher calling in life \u2013 for small deeds done everyday is no ordinary feat. It is also our hope that people who share our program will be moved to see that the nature that surrounds and nurtures us is in great need too of small acts of kindness and love.\u00a0 \u00a0This program is designed with the youth in mind, although anyone from 10 \u2013 110 will find it inspiring. Participants are encouraged to reflect on three social values that matter to individuals and our society today. We facilitate that by sharing how the same three values can actually be seen in nature. In the beautiful, lush and fruitful forest, we point out to participants that nature is brimming with goodness. By making the connection, that the forest is good and fruitful and that the same social values are present in the forest, we hope to inspire our participants to value these values. Perhaps the imagery of becoming a good and fruitful forest can then accompany them in their journey of life. Here\u2019s an example of what we mean. We value diversity in our society. It is a wonderful social value that stems from acceptance, respect for others and celebration of variety. We can point out the great diversity in Malaysian society \u2013 an almost endless feast of different ethnic foods, festivities that bind us, a staggering richness in folk art, and so on. So how can we be inspired by nature to protect diversity as a social value? Diversity of life-forms is almost always a defining feature of healthy ecosystems. In the forest, we point out the many layers of plant life at different sections, and the myriad animal communities that they support. Whenever a forest loses diversity, it becomes less fruitful by losing its ability to support as many animals, or becoming more prone to pest destruction. Sometimes, a forest ecosystem deprived of its key diversity can become so destabilised that it collapses. By making the connection between the social sphere and the natural world in a common value, we encourage our participants to see the value of diversity in an inspiring setting. Hopefully, the goodness and fruitfulness of a forest full of diversity can serve to strengthen our participant\u2019s appreciation of diversity in their life journey. As we walk through the forest, stopping at attractions and pretty spots (canopy walkway, stream, etc), participants are actively engaged through lively narration, games, personal storytelling and the thriving wildlife. A lovely personal journal with artworks is given to every participant to help in reflection. Views are heard and respected, time is taken to linger. Stories are shared over a delicious lunch. At the end of the walk, we will bring together the day\u2019s learning at a very special spot, and encourage participants to find their place in the great journey towards a better society. We do our best to serve the unique needs of our participants. This means we will spend time beforehand to listen to each group\u2019s needs and particular journey, customise and tweak the syllabus and conduct follow-up after the program. We therefore encourage group leaders or guardians to the participants to join the program, at no charge. This way, the learning and reflection can continue beyond the program with others who can encourage and build up.

Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) is a humane alternative to euthanasia for managing and reducing community stray cat and dog populations in Malaysia. TNRM relies on sterilisation of the animals so that they don\u2019t breed. In a nutshell,\u00a0 we\u00a0TRAP\u00a0stray cats and dogs,\u00a0NEUTER/spay them, then\u00a0RELEASE/re-home after post-op recovery in order to\u00a0MANAGE\u00a0the stray population in Malaysia in the most humane, effective and sustainable way. TNRM begins with the trapping of community strays using humane trapping methods. The captured strays are taken to a veterinary clinic where they are sterilised and vaccinated. The sterilised strays are marked so that they can be easily identified, usually by cropping the pointed end of the ear so that it has a square appearance (known as ear tipping) or cutting a notch (V-shape) at the tip or on the side of the ear. After the animal has recovered from surgery, it is subsequently released to the site of capture.\u00a0 The strays are then managed back in their original environment. A caregiver/community feeder then provides regular food and monitors the colony over time. With TNRM, the animals\u2019 reproductive capacities are eliminated, leading to a gradual decline in their numbers. \u00a0Sterilised animals also benefit in terms of health, with much lower risks of contracting certain diseases and a longer lifespan.\u00a0 Nuisance behaviours such as aggression, territorial marking, etc are also substantially reduced. We solely rely on public donations to operate.\u00a0 Funds collected mainly go to the neutering/spaying of stray animals, vaccinations, medical vet bills, purchasing equipment, maintenance of the TNRM Transit Centre and the maintenance of the TNRM Mobile.
